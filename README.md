<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br> 
Melodica Media Corp. is a multinational company headquartered in California, US that 
operates the namesake Melodica online music store. The store is comprised of downloadable 
MP4 files of songs that customers can download a piece. The company has contracted your 
team to create a Business Intelligence pipeline to analyze, track sales, and support the 
company’s decision-making process. 

<h3>Project Scope</h3>
<br>
The expected BI pipeline will consist of an OLTP, Staging area, and DW, to automate the 
process of Extract, Transform and Load of Data (ETL). A business intelligence report with 
selected visualizations that will load data directly from a tabular model based on the DW is 
also expected. This report will be shared as a dashboard with the managers.
